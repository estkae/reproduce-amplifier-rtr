# Reproduce amplifier for reel to reel tape recorders

Mainly built for Soviet-era tape recorders using heads: 6Ð’24.080 and similar. Main emphasis is made on accuracy of the reproduction, targeting both precise and noise free reproduction. For this reason it is using ultra low noise AD8429 instrumentation amplifiers and has very careful ground layout. 

It wasn't tested with other speeds than 19 cm/s speed.

Dedicated to my father Vladimir Sibiryakov.
